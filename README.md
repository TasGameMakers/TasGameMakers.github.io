## How to set up 11ty side

1. Install Node v14.17. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a good tool
   for this (and something the repo is set up to take advantage of if
   present).
2. Run `npm install` to install everything
3. Run `npm run serve` to build the site and start up a local
   webserver displaying it
