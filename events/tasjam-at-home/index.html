<h3>When</h3>
<p><b>Jam time</b></p>
<p>
    TasGM is running an online Tasjam starting from 10:00am Thursday 30th of
    April and running to 3:00pm on Sunday 3rd of May (Australian Eastern
    Standard Time).
</p>
<p>
    The event will kick off at 10:00am on Thursday, where we&#x27;ll go over the
    theme and the general code of conduct on Discord. We&#x27;ll run all day
    Thursday through to Sunday. At 3:00pm Sunday it’s pencils down and
    submissions are to be made to the &#x27;Tasjam at home&#x27; Itch page
    before 4:00pm.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <i>
        This is a longer jam session than usual, to give more time to fit game
        making around our busy lives. You can start and finish at times that
        work for you—we&#x27;ll be posting any important updates to the Discord
        channel.
    </i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Showcase</b></p>
<p>
    After the jamming session closes at 3:00pm Sunday, we&#x27;ll get together
    and showcase all the games that have been made over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
    Games will be posted to the &#x27;Tasjam at home&#x27; Itch page, and
    we&#x27;ll be playing and discussing together on Discord from 4:00pm.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>
    To participate, head to the
    <a href="http://itch.io/jam/tasjam-at-home">TasGM Itch.io event page</a>
    and keep in contact with the community and your teammates via our
    <a href="https://discord.gg/hJZ2DTS">Discord</a>. We&#x27;ll be opening a
    dedicated Discord channel and voice chat for the jam prior to commencement,
    so this is the place to go to keep up to speed with other makers around the
    state while the jam is running.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>
    There is no expectation to work as many hours as possible from Thursday to
    Sunday, so remember to take things at your own pace—this is a chill event,
    there are no prizes!
</p>
<p>
    Even though there is a statewide &#x27;stay at home&#x27; notice, you should
    remember to get out and stretch your legs/recharge between hours of furious
    game making.
</p>
<p>
    The &#x27;Tasjam at home&#x27; Discord channel is the perfect place to form
    teams, discuss ideas, and post screenshots of your work!
</p>
<p>
    This jam is not restricted to Tasmanian residents–jammers from anywhere
    around the world are more than welcome (and encouraged) to join in.
