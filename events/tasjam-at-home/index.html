                    <p>
                        TasGM is running an online Tasjam starting from 10:00am
                        Thursday 30th of April and running to 3:00pm on Sunday
                        3rd of May (Australian Eastern Standard Time).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The event will kick off at 10:00am on Thursday, where
                        we&#x27;ll go over the theme and the general code of
                        conduct on Discord. We&#x27;ll run all day Thursday
                        through to Sunday. At 3:00pm Sunday it’s pencils down
                        and submissions are to be made to the &#x27;Tasjam at
                        home&#x27; Itch page before 4:00pm.

                            This is a longer jam session than usual, to give
                            more time to fit game making around our busy lives.
                            You can start and finish at times that work for
                            you—we&#x27;ll be posting any important updates to
                            the Discord channel.

                        After the jamming session closes at 3:00pm Sunday,
                        we&#x27;ll get together and showcase all the games that
                        have been made over the weekend.

                    <p>
                        Games will be posted to the &#x27;Tasjam at home&#x27;
                        Itch page, and we&#x27;ll be playing and discussing

                            >TasGM Itch.io event page</a
                        >
                        and keep in contact with the community and your
                        teammates via our

                        We&#x27;ll be opening a dedicated Discord channel and
                        voice chat for the jam prior to commencement, so this is
                        the place to go to keep up to speed with other makers
                        around the state while the jam is running.

                    <h3>Remember</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no expectation to work as many hours as
                        possible from Thursday to Sunday, so remember to take
                        things at your own pace—this is a chill event, there are
                        no prizes!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though there is a statewide &#x27;stay at
                        home&#x27; notice, you should remember to get out and
                        stretch your legs/recharge between hours of furious game
                        making.
                    </p>
