    Jean and Blair Leggett, founders of One More Story Games (Toronto, Canada)
    will join us for an evening to talk about their indie startup and how they
    built a narrative game engine designed to help non-coding storytellers
    create point and click narrative games, including those as young as 8 years
    old.

    <br />This two hour session includes creating a short game using their
    engine StoryStylus, so make sure to bring along laptops/computers if you
    would like to participate.

    2013, run summer camps for kids, have published 5 games, won 3 Game of The
    Year awards in Toronto, and have raised over half a million dollars.<br />
