                        Come along to TasGM’s first showcase/demo event where
                        you can come and play games developed by the community
                        (and bring your own along too). This is a great chance
                        to chat to other creators in Hobart, get feedback, and
                        play a bunch of locally-made games!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have four games lined up already (and we welcome even
                        more!) :<br />I am Atlas - Ben Evans<br />Party Crashers
                        - Giant Margarita<br />Panoptiformer (or Corpses Coil) -
                        Shannon Woolley<br />Untitled game - Andrew Mendlik
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a game (in whatever form) that you would
                        like to show, feel free to bring it along on the day.
                        Get feedback from others in a supportive environment -
                        it doesn’t mater if it is rough or unfinished!
