<p>
    Come along to TasGM’s first showcase/demo event where you can come and play
    games developed by the community (and bring your own along too). This is a
    great chance to chat to other creators in Hobart, get feedback, and play a
    bunch of locally-made games!
</p>
<p>
    We have four games lined up already (and we welcome even more!) :<br />I am
    Atlas - Ben Evans<br />Party Crashers - Giant Margarita<br />Panoptiformer
    (or Corpses Coil) - Shannon Woolley<br />Untitled game - Andrew Mendlik
</p>
<p>
    If you have a game (in whatever form) that you would like to show, feel free
    to bring it along on the day. Get feedback from others in a supportive
    environment - it doesn’t mater if it is rough or unfinished!
