<p>
    Way back in February we all got together to talk about the future of our
    community. We put together an interim board who were charged with
    incorporating, re-branding, and effectively re-launching our community into
    the national arena.
</p>
<p>
    Well, in October we celebrated the launch of our new branding, touted our
    community to anyone with ears during Melbourne International Games Week, and
    are now officially an ‘Incorporated Association’!
</p>
<p>
    Now, as promised, it&#x27;s time for us to nominate and vote for our first
    official board! This is an historic time for Tas Game Makers, and we hope
    the community will embrace the process with a slew of exciting board
    nominations, and a healthy number of attendees at the AGM to vote.
