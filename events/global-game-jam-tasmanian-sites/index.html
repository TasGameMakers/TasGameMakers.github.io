                        you&#x27;re just curious about what goes on) game jams
                        are an awesome way to meet likeminded people, flex your
                        creative and technical skills and make your ideas come
                        to life.

                        Sunday, internet, and some snacky bits and pieces (plus

                    <h2>What is Global Game Jam?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Global Game Jam® (GGJ®) is the world&#x27;s largest
                        game creation event taking place in physical locations
                        across the globe. Think of it as a 48 hour hackathon
                        focused on game development around a theme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GGJ’s mission is to stimulate innovation,
                        experimentation, and collaboration in games. The annual
                        event begins on a Friday afternoon in January and kicks
                        off with video keynotes and advice from leaders in the
                        game development industry. The jam formally begins after
                        an announcement of the year’s theme, kept secret until
                        the last second, and not revealed publicly until 5pm at
                        our last time zone to start: Hawaii!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The GGJ encourages collaboration and is
                        <b>not a competition</b>. Anyone can apply to host a jam
                        site as long as they have a dedicated jam organiser who
                        agrees to follow a few GGJ rules, and a venue with
                        internet access.
