        Global Game Jam is an annual event that takes place simultaneously in
        more than 860 sites in 113 countries around the world for 48 hours, over
        the weekend of 31 January - 2 February 2020.

</p>
<p>
    Tasmanian Game Makers welcomes you to our official GGJ sites in 2020! If
    you&#x27;re planning on participating in GGJ 2020, we encourage people of
    all skillsets to pay a visit to our sites and create something this weekend.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever your background or expertise (or even if you&#x27;re just curious
    about what goes on) game jams are an awesome way to meet likeminded people,
    flex your creative and technical skills and make your ideas come to life.
</p>
<p>
    We&#x27;ll provide a space to jam on the Saturday and Sunday, internet, and
    some snacky bits and pieces (plus there&#x27;s lots of food and coffee
    venues nearby). Please BYO device.
</p>

<h2>What is Global Game Jam?</h2>
<p>
    The Global Game Jam® (GGJ®) is the world&#x27;s largest game creation event
    taking place in physical locations across the globe. Think of it as a 48
    hour hackathon focused on game development around a theme.
</p>
<p>
    GGJ’s mission is to stimulate innovation, experimentation, and collaboration
    in games. The annual event begins on a Friday afternoon in January and kicks
    off with video keynotes and advice from leaders in the game development
    industry. The jam formally begins after an announcement of the year’s theme,
    kept secret until the last second, and not revealed publicly until 5pm at
    our last time zone to start: Hawaii!
</p>
<p>
    The GGJ encourages collaboration and is
    <b>not a competition</b>. Anyone can apply to host a jam site as long as
    they have a dedicated jam organiser who agrees to follow a few GGJ rules,
    and a venue with internet access.
