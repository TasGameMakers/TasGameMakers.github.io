                        As part of FutureFest 2019, Tas Game Makers (in
                        partnership with ACS) is hosting a series of lightning
                        talks.<br /><br />Come along and listen to a range of
                        short talks by the TasGM community! For those
                        unfamiliar, a Lightning Talks session is a series of
                        short (+/- 5 min) talks by different speakers, in very
                        quick succession. Talks will cover skills, experiences,
                        or perspectives related to game development and will
                        come from members of the Tasmanian game making
                        community.<br />This is a free event, and a great
                        opportunity to share experiences and learn from other
                        skilled creators in the industry!
