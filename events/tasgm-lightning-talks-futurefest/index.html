    As part of FutureFest 2019, Tas Game Makers (in partnership with ACS) is
    hosting a series of lightning talks.<br /><br />Come along and listen to a
    range of short talks by the TasGM community! For those unfamiliar, a
    Lightning Talks session is a series of short (+/- 5 min) talks by different
    speakers, in very quick succession. Talks will cover skills, experiences, or
    perspectives related to game development and will come from members of the
    Tasmanian game making community.<br />This is a free event, and a great
    opportunity to share experiences and learn from other skilled creators in
    the industry!
