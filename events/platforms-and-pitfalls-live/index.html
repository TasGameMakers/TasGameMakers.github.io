    Come along and listen to a live recording of &#x27;Platforms and
    Pitfalls&#x27;! This podcast takes a new game-design specific topic each
    month and discusses it within the context of different games.

<p>
    TasGM hosted a live recording of Platforms and Pitfalls at the Enterprize
    co-working space in Hobart, Tasmania. Audience participation and suggestions
    were encouraged, and the event was live-streamed for those wanting to
    participate online. You can watch an archive of the event

    Platforms and Pitfalls is run by Rowan and Adam, who both can&#x27;t stop
    talking about the approaches, theory, and experiences of games.<br />Facebook
