<p>Welcome to TasJam: Undisciplined!<br /></p>
<p>
    In this, TasGM’s fifth TasJam, we&#x27;re encouraging a multidisciplinary
    approach to developing games, and would love to see participants from
    technical, musical, artistic, design, and writing backgrounds come together
    to form teams to build amazing games - let&#x27;s see what this creative
    island can do!<br />
</p>

    TasJam: Undisciplined will commence on Saturday 30th September at 10am, and
    end on Sunday 1st October at 4pm. Participants will get a theme on the day,
    and have 30 hours to create a game prototype!<br />

    Tasmania&#x27;s School of Engineering and ICT, Bitlink, Inspiring Australia,

    In addition to the main jam, we&#x27;ll be hosting a team formation event on
    the 19th of September at Enterprize Tasmania at 6pm to allow participants to
    meet each other and join teams if they don&#x27;t already have one!<br />
