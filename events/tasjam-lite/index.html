                        At TasJam Lite we want to encourage a chilled out,
                        relaxed jamming experience. As such, our theme for this
                        jam is ‘Calm’.<br />As with any theme, you can interpret
                        this theme in any way you see fit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re new to TasJam, or Games Jams in general, the
                        idea is you have 24 (ish) hours to make a game/proof of
                        concept/experience/anything based around a theme. If you
                        can’t make it in person, you can join us on our
                        <a href="https://discord.gg/zm5vxX4">discord server</a
                        >​​​​.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You don’t need any game making experience to attend and
                        participate - we have plenty of knowledgeable attendees
                        who are always willing to offer help and advice!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will be opening doors for people to set up at 9:00am
                        on the Saturday, and the event will kick off at 10:00am,
                        where we will go over the theme and the general code of
                        conduct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will run all day Saturday and Sunday, with brief
                        interludes for lunch and snacks. Similar to the last
                        TasJam LITE, food will not be provided. This provides
                        ample reason to get out and stretch your legs/gather
                        rations after hours of furious game making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At 3:00pm Sunday it’s pencils down and we will showcase
                        what you have all made!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mathematicians among you may note that an event that
                        runs from 9:00am Sat to 5:00pm Sun is longer than 24
                        hours. This is to encourage attendees to take time to
                        eat, sleep, and hydrate (mostly sleep) over the 2 day
                        period. We will be closing up the Enterprize space at
                        10:00pm Saturday night and re-opening at 10:00am Sunday.
                    </p>
                    <p>As this is a chill event, there are no prizes.</p>
