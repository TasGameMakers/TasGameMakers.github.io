<p>
    At TasJam Lite we want to encourage a chilled out, relaxed jamming
    experience. As such, our theme for this jam is ‘Calm’.<br />As with any
    theme, you can interpret this theme in any way you see fit.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re new to TasJam, or Games Jams in general, the idea is you have 24
    (ish) hours to make a game/proof of concept/experience/anything based around
    a theme. If you can’t make it in person, you can join us on our
    <a href="https://discord.gg/zm5vxX4">discord server</a>​​​​.
</p>
<p>
    You don’t need any game making experience to attend and participate - we
    have plenty of knowledgeable attendees who are always willing to offer help
    and advice!
</p>
<p>
    We will be opening doors for people to set up at 9:00am on the Saturday, and
    the event will kick off at 10:00am, where we will go over the theme and the
    general code of conduct.
</p>
<p>
    We will run all day Saturday and Sunday, with brief interludes for lunch and
    snacks. Similar to the last TasJam LITE, food will not be provided. This
    provides ample reason to get out and stretch your legs/gather rations after
    hours of furious game making.
</p>
<p>
    At 3:00pm Sunday it’s pencils down and we will showcase what you have all
    made!
</p>
<p>
    The mathematicians among you may note that an event that runs from 9:00am
    Sat to 5:00pm Sun is longer than 24 hours. This is to encourage attendees to
    take time to eat, sleep, and hydrate (mostly sleep) over the 2 day period.
    We will be closing up the Enterprize space at 10:00pm Saturday night and
    re-opening at 10:00am Sunday.
</p>
<p>As this is a chill event, there are no prizes.</p>
