                        The Game Developers Conference is the largest gathering
                        of industry professionals that happens in the US each
                        year. The
                        <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/">GDC Vault</a> is an
                        archive of talks and slides from the past 20 years of
                        the conference, containing valuable insight,
                        experiences, and technical learnings from practitioners
                        all over the world. Thanks to support from Screen
                        Tasmania, TasGM proudly offers access to this vault for
                        members.

                        Membership fees go towards a range of things: stipends
                        to compensate the time of some of our volunteers who are
                        providing a service (setting up streaming / recording),
                        budgets for event catering, venue hire, making an event
                        bigger (game jams, let’s plays) etc.
