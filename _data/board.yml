  bio: |
    I’m the co-founder of Secret Lab, a game development studio based in
    beautiful Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Secret Lab works on games and game
    development tools, including the award-winning ABC Play School iPad games,
    BAFTA- and IGF-winning Night in the Woods, the Qantas Joey Playbox, and the
    popular open source Yarn Spinner narrative game framework. I formerly
    worked as a software engineer, and product manager for Meebo, which was
    acquired by Google in 2012. I have a degree in medieval history, a PhD in
    Computing, and write technical books on machine learning, programming, and
    game development for O’Reilly Media. I can be found on Twitter [@parisba](https://twitter.com/parisba) and
    online at [http://paris.id.au](http://paris.id.au).

    Originally I was a scarecrow brought to life by a curse and had to work out how best to be a person. I long for a return to silently guarding sorghum from birds so towards that end I have been a part of numerous societies and even got a PhD.

    I've come to the conclusion making games is the best way to achieve my goal and as one of those weird Tasmanians who moved here instead of being born here it is impressive to have watched Tassie's growth. It is now the best place to make games and I want to make that known to all.

    My skills and perspective is that of a university student studying in the games and creative technology area. I hope to provide a fresh perspective of someone who has not yet been working in the area to allow insight into some of the differences between newcomers and people already working in the area and how we can all help each other with our goals.

    To do this I plan to focus on helping to grow our community so upcoming and established game creators can collaborate.
